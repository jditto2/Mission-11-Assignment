This project is built using React (frontend) and ASP.NET Core Web API (backend). As such, it does not use Razor Pages or Tag Helpers.
✅ Pagination and sorting are fully implemented using React state, JavaScript logic, and URL query parameters sent to the API.
✅ The backend supports paginated and sorted API responses using LINQ and EF Core.
Since this is a Single Page Application (SPA), Tag Helpers are not applicable or used.
